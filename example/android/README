To build libest for Android, first you'll need to build CiscoSSL
for Android and install it to some location.  For example, install
CiscoSSL to /nobackup/tmp/Wood/est/android/ssl

Next, set the following environment variables:

CC=arm-linux-androideabi-gcc
LDFLAGS=-L/nobackup/tmp/Wood/est/android/ssl/lib

Next, configure using this command:

../configure --with-ssl_dir=/nobackup/tmp/Wood/est/android/ssl --prefix=/nobackup/tmp/Wood/est/android/est --host=arm

Then do the normal make and make install



NOTE:  There were some issues with libc that looked to be resolved by 
       manually adding the following path to CFLAGs in the build/src/Makefile

-I/home/foleyj/Android/android-ndk-r7/platforms/android-14/arch-arm/usr/include
