This directory contains the libest project, which is an EST 
stack written in C.  EST is used for secure certificate 
enrollment and is compatible with Suite B certs (as well as RSA
and DSA certificates).  EST is a suitable replacement for SCEP.  

Directory contents:

    /src	This directory contains the EST library.  The
		target built from this directory is libest.a.
    /example	This directory contains sample code for implementing
                an EST client or server.
    /test	This directory contains unit test code to verify
                the libest capabilities.


Getting started
---------------
1.  ./configure; make; make install
2.  Descend into the example/server directory and run
    the sample EST server.  There is a README in this directory
    with detailed instructions.
3.  Descend into the example/client directory and run
    the sample EST client.  There is a README in this directory
    with detailed instructions.



Cross-compiling
---------------
libest has been cross-compiled for Android, but no testing
has been performed.  Follow these steps to compile using the 
Android NDK:

1.  Compile and install OpenSSL for Android.  

2.  Set the following environment variables to setup your cross-compile.
    This assumes you've installed OpenSSL into /usr/local/OpenSSL-Android:

    export CC=arm-linux-androideabi-gcc
    export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/OpenSSL-Android/lib
    export CFLAGS="-DDISABLE_BACKTRACE -DDISABLE_TSEARCH -DIS_FREEBSD"

    **Note: you may not need all the CFLAGS values above depending
            on your tool chain.

3.  Configure libest for cross-compiling and specify the location
    of your OpenSSL build:

    ./configure --with-ssl-dir=/usr/local/OpenSSL-Android \
	--host=arm-linux-androideabi \ 
	--disable-shared --disable-pthreads \
	--prefix=/var/android/libest

4.  Compile and install:

    make
    make install
